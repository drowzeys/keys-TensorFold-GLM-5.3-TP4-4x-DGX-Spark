# Full GLM-5.3 on four DGX Sparks (tensor parallel 4)

TensorFold's `glm_moe_dsa` family serves the full GLM-5.3 (753B total, ~40B active; `model_type: glm_moe_dsa`) across
four DGX Sparks (GB10, 128 GB unified memory each), one rank per Spark, over their ConnectX-7 200 GbE RoCE fabric.
It is TensorFold's first four-rank engine (the CLI now takes `--tp 1 | 2 | 4`, per family).

Decode keeps TensorFold's guarantees: a drafted reply is bit-identical to a serial one (every verify row has a serial
step's bits: row-invariant kernels, rank-order fp32 sums), concurrent replies equal the same request alone, and every
rank computes the same bits. Prompts longer than one chunk (~4K tokens) use the MoE prompt kernel, whose default fp32
atomic sums make such a prompt's reply vary run to run; `TF_EXL3_PROMPT_DET=slots16` makes them reproducible
(fp16 expert rows summed in a fixed order; ~4-6 % slower prefill).

## Measured (four DGX Sparks, 2.75 bpw EXL3 checkpoint)

Single stream, 32K-token context, temperature 1.0 / top-p 0.95, 512 tokens, 3 repeats; default settings, the public
incoai DFlash2 draft (the vLLM row: the same checkpoint and hardware, vLLM with EXL3 kernels, MTP k = 2, CUDA graphs,
RoCE all-reduce):

| | Prose | Code | Round | Prefill 8K / 32K / 128K | TTFT 32K / 128K |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TensorFold, DFlash2 (depth 7, confidence 0.3) | **27.7 tok/s** | **34.3 tok/s** | 78 / 89 ms | 1,044-1,087 / 1,035-1,124 / 996 tok/s | 29-31 s / 131 s |
| TensorFold, MTP k = 2 | 27.3 | 29.9 | **69.7 ms** | | |
| vLLM (same checkpoint, tuned) | 23.9 | 30.3 | 77-78 ms | ~755 / 749 / — tok/s | 43.6 s / — |

Short context, greedy: DFlash2 31.0 prose / **40.0** code (3.41 tokens a verify step); MTP 31.1 / 35.1 (62.6 ms a
round). Four concurrent streams (`--parallel 4 --context 32768`, DFlash2 drafts per stream): 69.7 chat / 95.4 code
tok/s aggregate greedy, TTFT ≤ 1.4 s.

### 1M-token context (decode context parallelism 4)

`--context 1000000` (anything past 200K turns it on; `TF_GLM53_DCP=4` forces it): the KV cache is interleaved over the
four ranks (position p on rank p % 4), each rank scores its own keys for the indexer and keeps a local top-2048, every
rank takes the same global top-2048, attends all heads over its own keys, and the log-sum-exp partials merge in rank
order — drafted replies still equal serial ones. ~25 GB of cache per rank at 1M. (Validated on the `2026-09-30`
revision; not re-run on `2026-10-03`, whose indexer top-k changes also reach this path.)

| Needle (passphrase at half depth) | Prompt | TTFT | Prefill | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128K | 133,162 tok | 419 s | 318 tok/s | PASS |
| 512K | 532,509 tok | 2,031 s | 262 tok/s | PASS |
| ~1M | 966,562 tok | 4,245 s | 228 tok/s | PASS |

Decode with DCP on: 25.9 prose / 28.6 code tok/s at short context (about 10 % below the replicated cache). DFlash2's
drafter keeps a 4096-slot ring of its sliding window, so it works at any context length.
Checkpoint quality vs BF16 (exllamav3 `model_diff`, 65,536 tokens): KL 0.124 nats, top-1 agreement 89.6 %.

## Run

Weights: an EXL3 GLM-5.3 checkpoint, e.g. [keys-GLM-5.3-EXL3-2.75BPW](https://huggingface.co/drowzeys/keys-GLM-5.3-EXL3-2.75BPW)
(routed experts 2/3/4-bit per expert, mean 2.75; 5-bit non-expert layers; 8-bit MTP), at the same path on all four
nodes (an NFS export works; each rank reads only its share through safetensors slices).

```sh
export NODES="spark1 spark2 spark3 spark4"   # fabric addresses, rank 0 first (serves HTTP)
export IMAGE=<CUDA 13 + torch image>          # + cuda-exl3 and vLLM for the fast prompt path (optional)
export CKPT=/models/GLM-5.3-EXL3-2.75BPW
export GIDS="3 3 3 3"                         # RoCE v2 GID index of each rank's port (check after reboots: they move)
tools/tp4_run.sh comm                         # fabric check: exact reduce-scatter bits, collective latencies
tools/tp4_run.sh serve --context 36864        # OpenAI-compatible server on rank 0, :8890
```

DFlash2 drafts: add `DOCKER_ENV="-e TF_GLM53_DFLASH=/models/GLM-5.3-DFlash2"` (e.g.
[incoai/GLM-5.3-DFlash2](https://huggingface.co/incoai/GLM-5.3-DFlash2)); requests choose with `"tf_mtp"`:
`"normed/normed"` (MTP, default), `"dflash"`, or `"auto"` (MTP or DFlash2 each round, whichever is emitting faster).
`~/tf-glm53/DFLASH_CFG` on every node (`{"depth": 7, "confidence": 0.3}`; 0.3 is the default) tunes DFlash2 at run time.

Node settings that matter on GB10:

- `sysctl vm.compaction_proactiveness=0` on every node: proactive memory compaction migrates pages under the GPU and
  stalls a rank ~130 ms at a time (a quarter of decode rounds took 200 ms instead of 70 before this).
- `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS=2` (the launcher's default): with NCCL's default channels a prompt chunk's all-reduce cannot run
  beside compute; with two it hides ~2/3 of its time.
- Keep bulk transfers (NFS copies, uploads) off the RoCE port while serving: they add decode latency.
- At 1M, GB10's allocator counts only free memory: drop clean page cache (`sysctl vm.drop_caches=1`) on the nodes
  while the engine loads — an NFS server node's cache otherwise crowds the warm-up — and raise the RoCE runtime's
  wait (`B12X_ROCE_SPIN_LIMIT=300000000`) so first-use kernel compiles cannot time out a collective.

## How it works

- `fused.py`: the whole forward on static buffers and device positions (CUDA-graph capturable), every kernel
  row-invariant: MLA with RoPE on the 576-wide latent (absorbed queries, chunked attention over per-row key lists),
  the V3.2 token-level indexer (top-2048, ties broken by position so the chosen set never depends on the window),
  EXL3 linears (the universal kernel; a decode-once tensor-core GEMM for prompt chunks), routed experts (TensorFold's
  universal experts kernel), RMSNorm/router/top-k/residual kernels from `glm5_next`.
- Collectives: decode windows reduce with a one-shot RoCE all-reduce (b12x RoCEnante, rank-order sums: the same bits
  as NCCL's all-gather + rank-order sum) when available; prompt chunks use NCCL's ring all-reduce of bf16 partials,
  as two micro-batches whose all-reduces overlap each other's compute.
- `experts_cx.py`: with cuda-exl3 available, each MoE layer's experts live once in cuda-exl3's per-width stacks; prompt
  chunks run its grouped GEMM and decode windows read the same memory through TensorFold's experts kernel
  (`gu_stride`: gate and up as column blocks of the fused trellis).
- `runner.py`: prompt chunks (equal sizes up to 4096 rows), then MTP rounds whose cache refresh merges with the first
  draft, DFlash2 rounds, or auto; every decode graph captured at startup.
- `dflash.py`: `glm5_next`'s DFlash2 drafter over this family (a bf16 vocabulary-share head).
